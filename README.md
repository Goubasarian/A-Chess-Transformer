# A Chess Transformer

In this project, we explored how much chess playing ability can emerge from simply mimicking the moves of strong players without an explicit objective to win, essentially copying the same apporach of next-token prediction in language models. We managed to achieve 98% legal-move accuracy and demonstrated wins against lower Stockfish levels, despite training only on move prediction rather than a direct game-winning objective.

## General/Future TODOs

- Instead of having utilities in colab notebooks, create util.py files
- Organize Repo so that there is a distinction between the autoregressive and standard approach (or even consider deleting the standard approach)

## Dataset

Data is originally from the [Lichess Elite Database](https://database.nikonoel.fr/). I made use of this [script](https://github.com/sgrvinod/chess-transformers/blob/main/chess_transformers/data/LE22c.sh) from sgrvinod which uses pgn-extract to extract the FENs, moves, and outcomes of the games within the pgn files. Note that the script applies a filter to keep only games that ended in checkmate and that used a time control of at least 5 minutes. 

The dataset consists of 26,701,685 half-moves, the FEN description of the board position that the move was played, and the outcome of the game (1 for win by white and -1 for win by black)

You may also download the raw [Moves](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1BSBuF2dKOnVWuR5CNjp-o7QBYb-10JTO) and [FENS](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1MC9UTgqE5074gVSVzrDzIJT7Hg1MHQac). 

The dataset contains two tables: data and encoded_data. The data table contains the raw FEN sequences, moves, and outcome of each game. The encoded_data contains the encoded FENs after applying a transformation, encoded moves, and outcome of each game.

## Non-Autoregressive Model

TODO: Add evaluation sections

## Autoregressive Model

### Evaluations

#### Legal move Accuracy

Results are achieved from testing the model checkpoints on one randomly samples position from 1000 games. The samples are the same across all of the checkpoints. Top-k sampling is used with k = 10.

#### Model vs Fairy-Stockfish

Below are the results of the estimated elo differences between the v1 model and various levels of fairy-stockfish. The estimated elos for each level of fairy-stockfish, according to a random user on the Lichess forum, are:

- Level 1: under 400
- Level 2: 500
- Level 3: 800
- Level 4: 1100
